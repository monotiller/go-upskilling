# go Upskilling
The aim of this exercise is to demonstrate go's ability to help automate tasks that may have to be done on a regular basis. The end goal is to be able to pass go a file of names (for example in a csv file) and have it automatically enter them into a database. From this we will then go further into hooking it into an instance of a popular SSO service to have go automatically create and set up new user accounts for us in bulk.
